      by the cookie about your use of this website is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there.
      However, if IP anonymisation is activated on this website, Google will reduce your IP address within Member States
      of the European Union or in other states party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area beforehand. Only in exceptional
      cases will the full IP address be transmitted to a Google server in the USA and shortened there. On behalf of the operator

      profiles, whereby you must contact Google to exercise this right.</p>

      is the case if processing is not necessary in particular to fulfil a contract with you, which is described by us in
      the following description of the functions. When exercising such objection, we ask you to explain the reasons why we
      should not process your personal data as we have done. In the event of your justified objection, we will examine the
