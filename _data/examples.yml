  title: Zoom UI
  description: Zooming patterns, as often found in mobile apps, can be created with the "canvas" layout. Here, frames have fixed positions on the "canvas" and can be scaled or rotated. During transitions, the canvas is transformed (moved, scaled, rotated) such that the active frame fits into the stage.
